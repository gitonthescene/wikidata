* Historical United States Senators

This project was started to try to reconcile data available from Wikidata with data at the
congressional [[https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/][bioguide site]].

** Files
  - [[file:historical-senator-congresses.tsv][historical-senator-congresses.tsv]] is data pulled from the bioguide with some enriched information
  - [[file:wikisenclasses.tsv][wikisenclasses.tsv]] is data pulled from the Wikipedia lists per state of historical
    senators. (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_senators_from_Georgia][Georgia]])
  - [[file:senclasses.tsv][senclasses.tsv]] contains data from the bioguide after being run through a program to backout the
    class from info on the current congress
  - [[file:wikisenclasses-extra.tsv][wikisenclasses-extra.tsv]] is simply a breakout of wikisenclasses.tsv of rows not found in senclasses.tsv
  - [[file:senclasses-extra.tsv][senclasses-extra.tsv]] is a breakout of senclasses.tsv of rows not found in wikisenclasses.tsv

** Processing
   The above general descriptions describe the sources of the data in the files, but the actual
   content of the files have gone through several rounds of refining using both one-off programs and
   manual inspection.

   The main tool used for reconciliation has been [[https://openrefine.org/][OpenRefine]].

*** Historical Senator Congresses

    :END:
    From the [[https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/][bioguide]] you can search for senators by congress.  Each senator has their own bioguide
    entry linked in the results.  ( For instance [[https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=B000084][Abraham Baldwin]] is linked from the list of Senators
    in the first congress. )  Each member has a Member XML file from this page.  ([[https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Static_Files/data/B/B000084.xml][This]] is the one
    for Abraham Baldwin.)

    These XML files contain info on which congresses the given senator has served in as well as a
    =uscongress-bio id= which serves as a unique identifier for each Senator.  They also make up the
    bulk of info in the table of historical senators congresses.

    The data was pulled in to OpenRefine and the fullname was reconciled against the Wiki base.
    This amounts to guessing which entry applies to the row based on the fullname.  To help with
    reconciliation and extra column was temporarily added to indicate that the name refers to a
    United States Senator.  Still there was ambiguity because of the prevalence of father/son pairs
    serving in the Senate.

    The =wikientity= column contains the /entity name/ of the Wikidata entry and was extracted from
    the reconciled column using the transformation =cell.recon.match.id=.

    Initial values for =start time= and =end time= were filled in with the start and end time of the
    given Congress using Wikidata as the source of this information.  The plan is to adjust the
    start time for senators who started mid-Congress using the [[https://www.senate.gov/senators/AppointedSenators.htm][list of Appointed Senators]] available
    at senate.gov.  Currently, this list is being reconciled against a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_appointed_United_States_senators][similar one]] on Wikipedia.

*** Senator classes
    This file contains one row for row of the table describe in [[#histsens][Historical Senator Congresses]] above.
    The Senate Class for each of the current Senators was pulled from this list of [[https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm][Senators of the
    116th Congress]].  (There is an [[https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.xml][xml file]] linked there for easy processing.)  Then a one-off
    program was written to backfill the Senate Class for historical Senators by trying to guess
    which Senator replaced which.  In an ideal world, the Senate Class model would ensure that only
    one Senator from each state would be replaced in each election.  The reality is far from this
    ideal.  A fair number of exceptions were manually inspected and adjusted using Wikipedia as the
    source of information when none other was available.

*** Wiki Senator Classes
    This file is mostly just a straight dump of the lists of historical senators referred to above.

*** Reconciliation
    With two files containing a row for each combination of congress number, state and class and
    senator.  For the cases where there is only one such for the combination of congress number,
    state and class the senator names should match.  For these cases we should then have a mapping
    from the =bioguide_id= to the wiki =entity= name and that mapping can be used to extrapoloate to
    the cases where there is no one-to-one mapping.  The Wiki Senator Classes file was updated with
    this mapping.

    Naturally, there were problems, such as having two options when extrapolating or names simply
    not being close the their supposed "match".  Further checks were run to test that the lower case
    versions of last names and first names matched.  Not one of these checks tied out exactly, but
    the reduced the number of cases requiring manual inspection.

    The reconciliation to the Wiki base in the Historical Senator Congress was also brought in play
    as a further check.  Both mappings were refined in the process.

    Eventually the mapping between identifiers was brought to be one-to-one.

*** Differences
    After the identifiers were matched we were in a position to find rows which occured in one table
    and not the other.  For convenience these were broken out into separate tables and enhanced with
    full URL's to the source of the senator data.
